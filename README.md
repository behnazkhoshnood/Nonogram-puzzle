### **Further Testing**

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox browser.

- The website was shown responsive on a variety of emulated devices such as Jio phone, iphone4, 5, SE, 6, 6 plus, 7, 7plus, 8, 8plus and X, Nokia Lumia 520 and N9, Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Blackberry Z30 and playbook, Galaxy note, Microsoft Lumia 950 and 550, LG Optimus L70, Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10, 6P, Pixel 2 and 2XL, iPad mini, iPad, Kindle Fire, iPad pro and laptop with MDPI, touch, and HiDPI.

- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## **Known Bugs**

- The sweep to bottom hover effect doesn't cover the buttons on some mobile phones.

- Sometimes the browser doesn't open the site but after reloading the page it workes properly.

## **Fixed bugs**

- To defrenciate between gray and colored buttons I was using the right and left mouse click but taphold on touch devices was not functional. I changed the codes by adding colored and gray buttons on the page and make functions related to if these buttons are active or not.

- Eror 404 fixed bt adding the favicon.ico .
